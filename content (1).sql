He remained in that same party for 26 years. It transformed in his hands. He became its general secretary and then president. Then he became the prime minister and then the president of the country. But his one commitment was to serve the people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1966 when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman raised the six-point demand in Lahore, there were not many people behind him. The president of the country warned of an armed response. Mujib just got three months to explain his demands to the people. And he did so to an enormous response. He was arrested and while in jail, charges were filed against him and others. This was the infamous Agartala conspiracy case. He was charged with treason, of conspiring to separate the eastern wing of Pakistan. But this only served to increase the empathy of the people of East Bengal towards Sheikh Mujib and ultimately led to a mass uprising. The Agartala case was withdrawn and Mujib was freed. President Ayub stepped down and Mujib became Bangabandhu.</p><p>The first general election of Pakistan took place in December 1970. Mujib termed this as a referendum in favour of the six points. His party won an absolute majority. However, conspirators were unwilling to relinquish power to him or to draw up the constitution on the basis of the six points. Bangabandhu called for the non-cooperation movement. The success of this movement amazed the world.</p><p>On 7 March Mujib addressed thousands of people at a public rally in the racecourse. This was his moment of glory. He called for each house to be made into a fort and for the people to face the enemy with whatever they possessed. He said, â€œWe have shed blood and will shed some more. We will free the people of this country, Insha Allah.â€ He said that this time the struggle was for freedom, for independence. This speech is now a world heritage. It still stands as an inspiration.</p><p>The Pakistan army launched a brutal genocide at midnight on 25 March. Bangabandhu was arrested. Prior to that, two English versions of Bangabandhuâ€™s declaration of independence were aired from three broadcast units. Bangabandhu was absent during the war of liberation, but the war was fought in his name.&nbsp;<br>The Bengalis first built up resistance against the Pakistani armed forces and then took up a counter attack.
